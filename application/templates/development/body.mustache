	<h2>Can you host my project?</h2>
	<p>
		Yes, we do offer hosting for addons and projects built using Kohana. 
		Please post in the <a href="http://forum.kohanaphp.com/comments.php?DiscussionID=2018">
		projects thread</a> to have an admin create a project for you. Hosted 
		projects get issue tracking, repository viewing, wiki, and news posting
		capabilities. If requested, we can also provide SVN repository hosting
		for your project. You may also use your own 
		<a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, 
		<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/">Mercurial</a>, or 
		<a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> repository for your 
		project.

	<p id="github">
		We highly recommend hosting your open source project on 
		<a href="http://github.com">Github</a> as a free alternative.
